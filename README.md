# iBalance
My first challenge from Apple Developer Academy - UFPE: an application that divides kids' cell phone usage time according to entered inputs by parents, suggesting the time to be spent in each apps' categories, as well as taking breaks when necessary.

Challenge's rules:

- We must use SwiftUI;
- The app must have just one screen;
- It must involve calculation.
